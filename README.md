# Hi, I'm Henrietta 👋

💡 A little about me:  
I started out in banking, helping people with accounts, wires, and all the daily money puzzles. Over time, I realized I loved solving *tech puzzles* even more — so I jumped into web development, data, and cloud.  

🌟 What I bring:  
- 🎓 Graduate of the Grace Hopper Fullstack Academy  
- ☁️ AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner  
- 🤖 Currently learning more about AI (and preparing for AWS AI Practitioner!)  
- 🛠️ Projects blending **compliance, data, and tech** — from dashboards to web apps  

✨ Outside of tech, I enjoy:  
- 🎨 Creating resin art (HenRes Designs 💎)  
- 🍳 Cooking and mixing creativity into everything  
- ⚽ Sports & a bit of sports betting fun 😉  

📚 Always learning, always building — whether it’s cloud, AI, or the next cool project.
